> Demonstration of design patterns isolating business rules from infrastructure.

## Visao geral

Design Patterns segue boas praticas of engenharia: estrutura of projeto idiomatica,
sefortion of responsibilities, environment-based configuration, and automated tests.
A especificacao tecnica complete esta in [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md).

## Stack

- **Language/runtime:** Rust (Cargo)

## Requisitos

- Rust 1.77 (stable)

## Como rodar

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Tests and quality

Pipeline of CI green and **coverage of 100%** (statements, branches, functions, lines).

```bash
cargo test
```

## Structure

```text
rust_example_design_patterns/
  Cargo.toml
  src/
    patterns.rs
  tests/
    core_test.rs
```

## Patterns adopteds

- Layout of projeto idiomatico of the language.
- Configuracao via variaveis of environment (Twelve-Factor App).
- Domain isolated from infrastructure; input validation at the edges.
